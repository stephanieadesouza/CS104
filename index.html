<h3> NJIT, sad69, Interior Design</h3>
<h2></h2><p style="background-color:rgb(33, 222, 112);">My name is Stephanie Desouza, I'm 18 years old, and I attend NJIT. My major is Interior Design and I choose this major because 
    <br> I was always fasinated with my father work in constructing homes and thought i'd be even cooler if I got to design the inside of the 
    <br>home. My home town is North Caldwell, NJ and I graduated from West Essex High School. Some of my hobbies consist of working out, 
    <br>creating art, and shopping. I enjoy reading poetry books, with my favorites being Rupi Kaur's poetries. Im a big foodie and love
    <br> trying new food. My comfort foods are cheese fries and donuts. I enjoy spending my summers at the beach with friends and family.
    <br> My favorite vacation spot is California because the beaches and vibes there are immaculate.
